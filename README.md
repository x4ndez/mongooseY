## Description
MongoDB? or MySQL? I don't know, I just want a database to stash everyone's data and sell it to our data overlords.  That's why I made mongooseY, inspired by X... but Y... and Mongofied.

## Developer Comments
This challenge was module 18 of the edX/Monash University bootcamp, focusing on NoSQL databases.  I learned a lot of new things from this unit; not even related to MongoDB, but I like the idea of having all the routes separate to the controllers.  It looks a lot more organised and separates their purposes instead of having it all in one routes or controllers directory like we used to do.

Now that I've done a MongoDB project, would I use MongoDB or MySQL?  I actually like both.  I like how identical MongoDB and Mongoose is to JavaScript, but similar can be achieved by using Sequelize on MySQL.  I think both present "annoyances" when handling data with JavaScript, but I feel like I worked a bit more with Sequelize so I've accustomed to it.  I think I need to spend some more time using MongoDB before I join the MySQL or MongoDB cult!

The acceptance criteria of this project were as follows:

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
